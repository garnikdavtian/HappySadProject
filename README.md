Emotion Detection using CNN
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow, NumPy, and other Python libraries to classify human emotions into two categories: happy and sad. The dataset consists of up to 300 randomly downloaded images from Google, depicting people with these emotions.

🚀 Features
Custom Dataset: Collected and preprocessed images of happy and sad people.
Deep Learning Model: A CNN built with TensorFlow for emotion classification.
Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to display training performance and sample predictions.
Model Training & Evaluation: Trained on a manually curated dataset with performance metrics analyzed.


🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)


📊 Results
The trained model achieves good accuracy in distinguishing between happy and sad emotions. The performance can be further improved with a larger and more diverse dataset.

📌 Future Improvements
Increase dataset size for better generalization.
Optimize CNN architecture for improved accuracy.
Deploy the model as a web or mobile application.
